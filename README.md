Dan's XBMC Movie and Trailer Browser

Combination of PHP and Javascript..

Reads an XBMC MYSQL database to get the info..

Needs an http path (internal or external) to load the fanart images from.

There's a lot of customisation needed for anyone else to get this working but i'm working on it!

cheers
